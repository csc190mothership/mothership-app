So far contains Auth login/register and account/profile view page through basic UI implementation.

App checks if user session is active, if not, go to Login Page where user can switch to Register Page if required. Once registered, a verification link will be sent to their email giving them full access to login. Database will get updated with new user ID and user will get to the Account page where they can view/update their information and logout of the app.
